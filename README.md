create schedule


1. Has to have categories 
- Exercise
- Training
- Studying
- Reading
- Meditating
- Social Life
- Programming
- Work

if there are no categories user is prompted with a button to add categories

if there are categories user has option to view or add more categories

{ Categories will consist of inner categories upon user request, such as -> {work: problem 106/203, 
									     problem 106: fix electrical faults}}
Categories will have a description that indicates what this category is all about
Categories will have goals and time that it will be due -> Goals will also be set on a higher importance level

Ideally algorithm will scour internet and find things that people who are successful in that category or goal
and fetch tips and etc.


2. Categories have to have users importance to categories
- Exercise = 10
- Social Life = 4

3. For a schedule to be complete, for example
- A daily schedule will have: 
	1. 24HR time displayed with things to do at specific times of day
	2. Upon clicking/hovering specific category at time on displayed schedule animation will occur and display description,
	   ability to update description, ability to change importance for the day, change time of day in which you wish to complete,
	   button to re-create daily schedule based on new changes, 
	
	3. 

How will algorithm know which things to do before what?

when creating a category user will be prompted to enter some values for how important the category/task/goal is, as well as deadline,
what time the user prefers to do it at (morning, afternoon, evening), user will also be prompted to enter wake up and bed time,
